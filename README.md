# Dashball - "Official Rules"

Dashball is a team game playable by relatively few players with minimal equipment and whatever playing field is available. There are no truly official rules as the purpose of Dashball is to adapt to circumstances at hand. That said, this document describes more typical game play forms.

## Equpiment
* Baseball style: a wiffleball bat and ball or something of a similar ilk. Best to use a ball that can be caught without gloves and does not hurt when someone throws one at you
* Kickball style: a kickball or a soccer ball

## Playing field
A sufficiently large grass field is recommended. The ideal size depends on the number of players and their ages/atheltic capabilities. A baseball diamond or an indoor gym works, too. Ultimately, the field should look like the following:

Out of bounds areas should be collectively agreed upon before the start of the game, as well as the general distance between the batting area, pitching area, and base. 

Original games of dashball featured a fence at the far end of the field that served as the home run boundary and the base. Alternatively, the field can be more akin to a baseball field where the (second) base is somewhat in the middle of the playing field.

Generally, the wider the "in bounds" area of the field, the farther back the base should be.

## Players
Dashball works best with three to eight players but can be played with more.

If there are three players, there is one person per team. Each inning features two "teams" playing defense in the field while the other "team" bats; after each inning the teams rotate so each team bats every three innings.

For four players: two people per team.

For five players: 
* Three players on one team, two on the other. Ideally, the teams are balanced based on athletic ability but if every player is generally comparable, the team with two players can be given some compensating advantage, like an extra out per inning or a larger in-bounds area.
* Two vs. two with the extra player serving as permanent pitcher. This option can work well when you have one adult and four kids.

For six players:
* Two teams of three players.
* Three teams of two players. Two teams field while the third bats. Each team takes a turn batter every three innings.

For seven players:
* Four players on one team, three on the other. The three-player team may be given some compensating advantage.
* Two teams of three with the extra player serving as permanent pitcher.
* Three teams of two with the extra player serving as permanent pitcher.

For eight players:
* Two teams of four.
* Four teams of two.
* Three teams: two teams of three and one team of two. The two person team can be given some compensating advantage.

## The Objective
Score as many points as possible. The team with the highest score wins.

## Safety Consideration
* To avoid collisions with the pitcher or another base runner, players should always run to the left of the pitching area.
* When throwing a ball at a base runner, try not to aim at the head or face. Instances can be discouraged by giving the base runner an instant home run or at least not causing an out.
