# Dashball - "Official" Rules

Dashball is a team game meant to be playable with relatively few players, minimal equipment, and whatever playing field happens to be available. There are no truly official rules as the purpose of Dashball is to adapt to circumstances at hand.

## Equpiment
* Baseball style: a wiffleball bat and ball or something of a similar ilk. Best to use a ball that can be caught without gloves and does not hurt when someone throws one at you
* Kickball style: a kickball or a soccer ball

## Playing field
There are no standard dimensions for a playing field, just a sufficiently large and relativelty flat area. The ideal size depends on the number of players and their ages/atheltic capabilities. A baseball diamond or an indoor gym works, too. Ultimately, the field should look like the following:

### Batting Area, Pitching Area, and Base

The three essential areas of a playing field are:
* The batting area - where the batting team hits or kicks from
* The pitching area - where balls are thrown to the batter or rolled to the kicker (you don't need a pitching if playing T-Ball style)
* The base - where batters run after hitting or kicking the ball

If batters maange to hit/kick the ball pitched/rolled to them, they must run to the base. Therefore, the base should be within a decent distance from the batting area. Similarly, the pitching area should be a respectable distance from the batting area so the pitcher can field, as there are generally few fielders.

### In-Bounds/Out-Bounds

Out of bounds areas should be collectively agreed upon before the start of the game. If there are only a couple of fielders, keep the in-bounds somewhat narrow; if there are more, make them wider.

There may or may not be a "home run" boundary; it depends on the playing field and collective decision of the players. For example, if playing in a field with a fence, balls hit/kicked beyond the fence are typically considered home runs, but if playing in a gym, there are no home runs; balls that bounce against the back wall are considered playable. 

Also, because there is no catcher positions and generally few fielders, it's common to also establish a minimum distance that balls must be hit/kicked to be considered in-play.

### Base Placement

Original games of dashball were played in a field that had a fence at the far end; it served as the home run boundary and the base. Alternatively, the field can be more akin to a baseball field where the (second) base is somewhat in the middle of the playing field.

Generally, the wider the "in bounds" area of the field and/or the faster the base runners, the farther back the base should be.

## Players
Players are organized into two or three teams. When two teams play, teams alternate batting and fielding. When three teams play, two teams are in the field while the third bats in this rotation:

| Batting | Fielding    |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Team 1  | Teams 2 & 3 |
| Team 2  | Teams 1 & 3 |
| Team 3  | Teams 2 & 3 |

Dashball works best with three to eight players but can be played with more. 

* **Three Players** Three teams, one person per team.
* **Four Players** Two teams, two people per team.
* **Five Players**
  * Approach 1: Two teams, three players on one, two on the other. Ideally, teams are balanced based on athletic ability but if every player is generally comparable, the team with two players can be given some compensating advantage, like an extra out per inning or a larger in-bounds area.
  * Approach 2: Two teams, two players on each team with the extra player serving as permanent pitcher. This option can work well when you have one adult and four kids.
* **Six Players**
  * Approach 1: Two teams, three players per team.
  * Approach 2: Three teams, two players per team. Two teams field while the third bats. Each team takes a turn batting once every three innings.
* **Seven Players**
  * Approach 1: Four players on one team, three on the other. The three-player team may consist of the strongest players or be given some compensating advantage.
  * Approach 2: Three teams of two with the extra player serving as permanent pitcher.
  * Approach 3: Two teams of three with the extra player serving as permanent pitcher.
* **Eight Players**
  * Approach 1: Two teams, four players per team.
  * Approach 2: Three teams; two teams have three players and the third team has two. The two-player team may consist of the strongest players or be given some compensating advantage.

## Game Play
Game play is similar to baseball. 
* Batters attempt to hit the balls thrown at them. If they fail to connect in three (good) throws, they're out. Bad throws are considered balls. There are no walks.
* If a batter hits the ball into play, fielders attempt to get the batter out while the batter runs to the sole base. Fielders can get the batter out by
  * Catching the ball before it hits the ground
  * Throwing and hitting the base runner with the ball while the base runner is not on base.
  * Touching the base runner with the ball while the base runner is not on base.
* There is only one base. Once a batter hits/kicks the ball into play, the batter must run to the base area. 
  * After arriving on base safely, a runner can choose to run back home or remain on base.
  * Note: if playing one person per team and the a batter makes it to base but decides not to attempt to run home to score, the batter returns home to bat again but does not score a point. That is, the batter does not get out but also does not score.
* While a ball is in play and a base runner makes it home, the batting team scores a point. The base runner can be the one who batted the ball or a runner on base from the previous play. There is no base stealing.
* The number of outs per inning is the same as the number of players on the team, two at a minimum.
* The team with the highest score wins. 

## Safety Considerations
* To avoid collisions with the pitcher or another base runner, players should always run to the right of the pitching area.
* When throwing a ball at a base runner, don't to aim at the head or face.
