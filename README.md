# Dashball - "Official" Rules

Dashball is a team game meant to be playable with relatively few players, minimal equipment, and whatever playing field happens to be available. There are no truly official rules as the purpose of Dashball is to adapt to circumstances at hand.

## Equpiment
* Baseball style: a wiffleball bat and ball or something of a similar ilk. Best to use a ball that can be caught without gloves and does not hurt when someone throws one at you
* Kickball style: a kickball or a soccer ball

## Playing field
There are no standard dimensions for a playing field, just a sufficiently large and relativelty flat area. The ideal size depends on the number of players and their ages/atheltic capabilities. A baseball diamond or an indoor gym works, too. Ultimately, the field should look like the following:

### Batting Area, Pitching Zone, and Base

The three essential areas of a playing field are:
* Batting Area - where the batting team hits or kicks from, also know as "home"
* Pitching Zone - where balls are thrown to the batter or rolled to the kicker (you don't need a pitching if playing T-Ball style)
* Base - where batters run after hitting or kicking the ball

If batters manage to hit/kick the ball pitched/rolled to them into play (i.e. an in-bounds area), they must run to the base, so the base should be within a reasonable distance from the batting area. Similarly, the pitching zone should be a respectable distance from the batting area so the pitcher can reach the batter but also be able to field, as there are generally few fielders.

### In-Bounds/Out-Bounds

Out of bounds areas should be collectively agreed upon before the start of the game. If there are only a couple of fielders, keep the in-bounds somewhat narrow; if there are more, make them wider.

There may or may not be a "home run" boundary; it depends on the playing field and collective decision of the players. For example, if playing in a field with a fence, balls hit/kicked beyond the fence are typically considered home runs, but if playing in a gym, there are no home runs; balls that bounce against the back wall are considered playable. 

Also, because there is no catcher positions and generally few fielders, it's common to also establish a minimum distance that balls must be hit/kicked to be considered in-play.

### Base Placement

Original games of dashball were played in a field that had a fence at the far end that served as both the home run boundary and the base. Alternatively, the field can be more akin to a baseball field where the (second) base is somewhat in the middle of the playing field.

Generally, the wider the "in bounds" area of the field and/or the faster the base runners, the farther back the base should be.

## Players
Players are organized into two or three teams. When two teams play, teams alternate batting and fielding. When three teams play, two teams are in the field while the third bats in this rotation:

| Batting | Fielding    |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Team 1  | Teams 2 & 3 |
| Team 2  | Teams 1 & 3 |
| Team 3  | Teams 2 & 3 |

Dashball works best with three to eight players but can be played with more. 

* **Three Players** Three teams, one person per team.
* **Four Players** Two teams, two people per team.
* **Five Players**
  * Approach 1: Two teams, three players on one, two on the other. Ideally, teams are balanced based on athletic ability but if every player is generally comparable, the team with two players can be given some compensating advantage, like an extra out per inning or a larger in-bounds area.
  * Approach 2: Two teams, two players on each team with the extra player serving as permanent pitcher. This option can work well when you have one adult and four kids.
* **Six Players**
  * Approach 1: Two teams, three players per team.
  * Approach 2: Three teams, two players per team. Two teams field while the third bats. Each team takes a turn batting once every three innings.
* **Seven Players**
  * Approach 1: Four players on one team, three on the other. The three-player team may consist of the strongest players or be given some compensating advantage.
  * Approach 2: Three teams of two with the extra player serving as permanent pitcher.
  * Approach 3: Two teams of three with the extra player serving as permanent pitcher.
* **Eight Players**
  * Approach 1: Two teams, four players per team.
  * Approach 2: Three teams; two teams have three players and the third team has two. The two-player team may consist of the strongest players or be given some compensating advantage.

## Game Play
Game play is similar to baseball.
* The batting team gets _X_ outs per inning, where _X_ is equal to the number of players or 2, whichever is larger. This is to ensure every player gets to bat at least once per rotation. Outs occur only when:
  * The batter fails to hit/kick the ball after 3 good throws
  * A fielder catches the ball hit/kicked by the batter before the ball touches the ground
  * A batter not on base is hit by the ball when thrown by a fielder
  * A batter running to or from base intentionally runs into, trips, or otherwise encroaches on a fielder
  * A fielder in possession of the ball touches the batter with the ball while the batter is not on base
* Batters score by running a circuit from the batting area to base and back to home again. Players can complete this circuit in one or two at bats
  * One at bat example: batter hits a home run OR batter makes it to base and back without getting out
  * Two at bat example: batter 1 hits the ball into play and gets on base. Batter 2 hits the ball into play and the player on base runs back home without getting thrown out.
  * Note: if playing one person per team and the a batter makes it to base but decides not to attempt to run home to score, the batter returns home to bat again but does not score a point. That is, the batter does not get out but also does not score.
* You cannot have multiple players on base.
* Batters are not required to "tag up" (i.e. return to base) when a ball is caught by a fielder.
* Batters attempt to hit the balls thrown at them. If they fail to connect in three (good) throws, they're out. Bad throws are considered balls. There are no walks.
* A player on base cannot attempt to steal home.

## Safety Considerations
* To avoid collisions with the pitcher or another base runner, players should always run to the right of the pitching area.
* When throwing a ball at a base runner, don't aim at the head or face.
